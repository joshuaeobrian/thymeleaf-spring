Spring Controller renders template
@Controller vs @RequestMapping - See Code




Difference between viewing in Spring(Localhost)
    when using spring if the html file is the template folder you need to make sure you create a controller and
    a @RequestMapping for that page with the url you would like it to be and the page that you would like to load.
    doing it this way allows you to load the webite with data using addons like thymeleaf.

    (if local network has ports open you could view application across the network locally)

IntelliJ preview;
    This method will still show it as local host but it cannot connect to any kind of java file. Unless you where using
    javascript and you had a spring app running that  accepting requests to be made through things like a RestController
    in example. other than that thymeleaf would be useless and would not be populate the page.

    (Can not access and view over local network with out possible shared files)

Direct file access
    would allow you to do veiw little unless you where using JavaScript. Thymeleaf will wouldnt work.
